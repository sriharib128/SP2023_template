##### Instructions for Lab Submission:

1. The code must be written in MATLAB.
2. When using the plot function, make sure to clearly label the x-axis, y-axis, and provide a plot title.
3. Save all plots in the "Plots" folder and code files in the "Codes" folder.
4. Save plots only in .png/.jpg/.jpeg format (do not use .fig).
5. Submit a well-written report in PDF format (Report.pdf) containing the generated plots, your observations, and answers to the theory questions.
6. Include details of both teammates in the report.
7. You may add pictures of handwritten solutions to theory questions in the report.
8. Ensure that each script file is named as q<Question_Number>_<Sub_Part>.m (e.g., q2_c.m).
9. Do not change the names of function files.
10. Do not commit any changes after the deadline.
11. Commit after completing each question to avoid last-minute errors.
12. Do not create additional folders beyond the specified structure.
13. The final directory structure should resemble the following:
- |_ Inside cloned folder
  - |_ Plots      
    - |_ q1_a.jpg
  - |_ Codes
    - |_ q1_a.m       
  - |_ Report.pdf
  - |_ README.md
